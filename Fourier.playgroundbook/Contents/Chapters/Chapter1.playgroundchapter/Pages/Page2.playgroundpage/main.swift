 # ðŸ¤¯ Summing Up Signals

 Here we're gonna do exactly what the title says: Summing up multiple signals to get a new signal, a so-called **sum signal**.

 Give the first sum signal a try by running the code. Also try the other signals by uncommenting their respective code line.

 **Weighted signal sums** are also possible. Try it out by uncommenting the following line of code:

 ### ðŸ”Ž An interesting observation
 Try out the following **weighted sum signal** by uncommenting the line of code:

 It looks astonishingly similar to the **triangle signal**, right? To compare it with the original triangle signal, uncomment the following two lines of code!

 This observation is no coincidence, and [on the next page](@next) you're going to understand why!
