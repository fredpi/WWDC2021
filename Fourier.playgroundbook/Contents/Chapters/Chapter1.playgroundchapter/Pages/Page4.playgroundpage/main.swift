 Run the code and see how the Fourier series evolves as more coefficients are taken into account each step.

/*:
 As you can see, this signal cannot be exactly replicated via its Fourier series â€“ **there's always an overshoot** at those places where the rect signal jumps from -1 to 1 or vice versa (*even if âˆž coefficients were to be taken into account*). And that's the **Gibbs Phenomenon**!

 This behavior means that an exact representation of periodic signals as a Fourier series is only possible **if the signal is continuous** which means that it doesn't suddenly jump from one point to another (as the rect signal does e. g.)

 - Note:
 [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_phenomenon) has more information on the Gibbs phenomenon.
